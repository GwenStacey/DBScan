# DBScan:
Simple implementation of the DBSCAN algorithm

# The Why:
I created this short, easy to follow implementation of DBScan as a school project, to practice the concepts behind the algorithms I use on a regular basis.

# The How:
Usage is as basic as this algorithm itself. Grab some 2 dimensional data(this quick algorithm only likes it in 2-D right now) and run the .fit method. Once fit, you can run some basic plotting code, demonstrated in the .py files themselves, to get a picture of your clusters. From there you can tweak the various hyperparameters to improve your fit. Once you're satisfied with your clusters, you can use the .predict method to determine a cluster for new data!
